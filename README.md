# The_player_you_need


In this repository we used the dataset of all the players of the 5 best leagues in Europe. In this data set there are many statistics that are considered to have a clear view of the passes, tackles, crosses, shots on goal, goals scored etc. just to mention a few in which it is possible to obtain the average of the players of Manchester City and Manchester United.

The idea of the project was developed in Pandas with the help of different libraries and exported to Tableau to generate a quality interactive visualization. Different Dashboards were generated, in which the comparison of the two teams was presented and in which specific areas based on the dataset could be seen a dominance of Manchester City over Manchester United.

This is done in order to find players that can close the gap between the two teams, the purpose of this is to find the players that Manchester United could hire based on the dataset to fight for the Premier League next year.

At the end of the dataset, players are found, which are then searched on TRasfermarkt to give a stipulated recommendation of the monetary value needed to acquire a defender, a midfielder and a striker who can choose to generate an improvement for Manchester United.

It should be noted that the dataset does not contain all the data that in my opinion are essential to judge a player's ability. An example of this would be speed of the player.
